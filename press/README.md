## Technology

_The Artist Is Present_ was created using [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io), my favorite 2D game library for JavaScript. It makes use of [Colbydude](https://github.com/Colbydude)'s [Phaser 3 Palette Swapping Example](https://github.com/Colbydude/phaser-3-palette-swapping-example) to do recoloring of the audience members so they look different from one another.
